# WKS Platform Installation Guide for Remote Servers

:::note
To be moved to Introduction & Platform Architecture

## 🌟 Introduction

Multi-tenancy on the WKS Power Platform is designed to provide each tenant with a secure and isolated operational environment, akin to providing separate office suites within a single corporate building. This architecture allows service providers to manage multiple clients efficiently while ensuring that each client's data and operations remain private and secure.

## 🏛️ Architectural Overview

### Tenant URL Structure 🌐

- Each tenant accesses their environment through a unique subdomain, following the format tenant_id.somedomain.com (e.g., saasCustomer1.wksplatform.com).
- This subdomain serves as the dedicated entry point to the tenant’s specific portion of the platform, ensuring direct and secure access.

### Keycloak Realms 🔐

- Each tenant has a separate Keycloak realm, providing a dedicated security domain that controls authentication and authorization. This setup ensures that user credentials and permissions are managed locally within each tenant's realm, enhancing security and privacy.
- Upon onboarding a new tenant, a realm is specifically created and configured with unique security settings and user management protocols tailored to meet the tenant's needs.

### MongoDB Databases 🗃️

- Each tenant has a separate database to store tenant-specific data securely and maintain complete data isolation between tenants.
- Creating a dedicated MongoDB database for each new tenant setup, ensuring that data from one tenant is completely inaccessible to another.
