- ## For Java Applications ‚ô®Ô∏è
    - **Build-Time Configuration:** Environment variables for Java applications are typically defined in `application.yml` files located at the root of each Java project (e.g., the REST-API).
    - **Docker Compose Overrides:** These variables can be overridden at application startup through command line arguments or through Docker Compose configurations. For example, `CAMUNDA_BASE_URL` might be set in the `application.yml`, but it can be overridden by Docker environment settings to suit different deployment environments.
- ## For React Case-Portal ‚öõÔ∏è
    - **Build-Time Configuration:** Environment variables for the React Case-Portal are set during the build phase. These are defined in a `.env` file, which must be prepared before building the application.
    - **Docker Compose Overrides:** When deploying with Docker, the environment variables set in the React project's `.env` file can be overridden by those specified in the `docker-compose` files. This is critical when settings need to be adjusted post-deployment without rebuilding the app.
- ## For Node Applications üåê
    - **Build-Time Configuration:** Node applications, such as the mail-sender, use `.env` files for environment configuration. These are crucial for running the applications in different environments, whether locally with Yarn or in Dockerized environments.
    - **Docker Compose Overrides:** In Docker environments, the settings in `.env-sample` are overridden by those specified in the `docker-compose.yml` files. This allows for easy customization of environment variables without modifying the application's code.
