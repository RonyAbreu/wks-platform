Installation involves several key steps to ensure all components of the WKS Power Platform are properly set up and integrated:

## Prerequisites
    - Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.
    - Java 17 and Maven 3.8.x or higher are installed for building the Spring Boot microservices.
    - Node.js, npm, and Yarn are installed for building and running the Node.js React apps.

## Step 1: Preparation

### I. Clone the WKS Platform repository.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/wkspower/wks-platform.git
    cd wks-platform
    ```
### II. From the project root folder, navigate to the java project folder.
    ```bash
    cd apps/java
    ```
### III. Build all the microservices at once using Maven for later usage.
    ```bash
    mvn clean install package
    ```

## Step 2: Custom Domain Configuration
:::note
Skip if you only intent to only use it on localhost
:::

- Copy settings from `/.env-sample` to `/.env` then updated the file to configure essential service URLs, Keycloak Realms, and operational flags:
    - `MONGO_DEMO_DATA_LOADER_DATABASE=subdomain`
    - `KEYCLOAK_TOKEN_URL=http://keycloak:8080/realms/subdomain/protocol/openid-connect/token`
    - `WEBSOCKET_ENABLED=true`
    - `WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://subdomain.domain.io:8484/`
    - Optional for novu notifications:
        - `NOVU_ENABLED=true`
        - `NOVU_PUBLISHER_API_URL=http://subdomain.domain.io:3002/`
        - `NOVU_APP_ID=your-id`
        - `NOVU_API_KEY=your-key`
    - Default Usernames & Passwords also can be changed:
        - `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin`
        - `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin`
        - `KEYCLOAK_DEFAULT_USER=demo`
        - `KEYCLOAK_DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD=demo`
        - `KEYCLOAK_DEFAULT_USER_FIRST_NAME=demo`
        - `KEYCLOAK_DEFAULT_USER_LAST_NAME=demo`
        - `KEYCLOAK_DEFAULT_USER_EMAIL=demo@demo.com`

- Update `docker-compose.portal.yaml:` to ensure front-end configuration aligns with backend services:
    - `REACT_APP_KEYCLOAK_URL=http://subdomain.domain.io:8082/`
    - `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://subdomain.domain.io:8081/`
    - `REACT_APP_STORAGE_URL=http://subdomain.domain.io:8085/`

## Step 3: Deployment

### Run Full Startup Shell Script.
    ```bash
    sh docker-full-startup.sh
    ```
After successfully running the shell script to start all of the the Docker Compose configurations, it may take a while for all the web applications to finish their startup process.

## Step 4: Service Configuration (Skip if application domain havn't been customized)

Once the startup is complete, Manually replace wks-portal Keycloak Client's `Web origins` and `Valid redirect URIs` to match your domain.
