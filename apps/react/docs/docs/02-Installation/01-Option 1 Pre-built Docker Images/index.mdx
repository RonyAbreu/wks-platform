# WKS Platform Installation Guide

## Option 1: Running with Pre-built Docker Images

:::warning
**⚠️ For Development/Test Environments Only ⚠️**<br />
The provided docker-compose files are recommended only for use in development or test environments.

To quickly set up and run the project in a development environment, you can use pre-built Docker images. This approach ensures that all necessary dependencies and services are configured automatically, providing a seamless and consistent environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wkspower/wks-platform-docker.git
cd wks-platform-docker

# Now choose one of two options below:

# For camunda 7
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.camunda7.yaml -f docker-compose.demo-data-loader.camunda7.yaml -f docker-compose.portal.yaml up -d --build "$@"

# For camunda 8
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.camunda8.yaml -f docker-compose.demo-data-loader.camunda8.yaml -f docker-compose.portal.yaml up -d --build "$@"
```

After successfully running `docker-compose up` to start the Docker Compose configuration, it may take a while for all the web applications to finish their startup process. Once the startup is complete, you can access the following web applications:

- **WKS Platform Portal**: You can access the WKS Platform Portal by opening your web browser and navigating to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001). Use the following credentials to log in: 
    - Username: demo
    - Password: demo

- **Camunda**: To access the Camunda web application, open your web browser and visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Use the following credentials to log in: 
    - Username: demo
    - Password: demo

- **Keycloak**: Access the Keycloak web application by opening your web browser and visiting [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082). Use the following credentials to log in as an administrator: 
    - Username: admin
    - Password: admin

- **MinIO**: Access the MinIO web application by opening your web browser and visiting [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000). Use the following credentials to log in as an administrator: 
    - Username: minio
    - Password: #minio00#

Please note that it may take some time for the web applications to become fully operational, especially if this is the first time you are running them. If you encounter any issues, wait a few moments and try accessing the applications again.

Additionally, the MongoDB database used by these applications is running on port 27017.

Remember to ensure that you have Docker installed on your system before running the `docker-compose up` command.
